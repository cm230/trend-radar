AI,Generative AI,0,Act Now,"Automatic trailer generation, Automatic cover image generation","Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's) are unsupervised deep learning systems comprised of two competing neural networks trained on the same data—such as images of people. For example, the first A.I. creates photos of a woman that seem realistic, while the second A.I. compares the generated photos with photos of real women. Based on the judgment of the second A.I., the first one goes back and makes tweaks to its process. This happens again and again, until the first A.I. is automatically generating all kinds of images of a woman that look entirely realistic. Last year, Nvidia launched GauGAN (named after post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin), a generative adversarial A.I. system that lets users create lifelike landscape images that never existed.","https://mobidev.biz/blog/future-ai-machine-learning-trends-to-impact-business#nav8
